/// A `std::io::Write` implementation that makes a chunked hyper response body stream.
/// Automatically applies `gzip` content encoding if requested by the client.
///
/// The stream is infinitely buffered; calls to `write` and `flush` never block. `flush` thus is a
/// hint that data should be sent to the client as soon as possible, but this shouldn't be expected
/// to happen before it returns. `write` and `flush` may return error; this indicates that the
/// client certainly won't receive any additional bytes, so the calling code should stop producing
/// them.
///
/// The infinite buffering avoids the need for calling code to deal with backpressure via futures
/// or blocking. Many applications anyway produce output while holding a lock or database
/// transaction that should finish quickly, so backpressure must be ignored anyway.
///
/// On drop, the stream will be "finished" (for gzip, this writes a special footer). There's no way
/// to know the complete stream was written successfully. It's inherent in the combination of
/// HTTP / TCP / Unix sockets / hyper anyway that only the client knows this.
